A diary of my weekly code breakdown


Week one was a bit of a challenge, the information really scales quickly but I really learnt a lot in a small time, the recap of my JS would be the learning of:
Functions
Loops
Variables
If Statements

We developed on these creating a game of rock paper scissors that utialised all of the above!
I will be spending some time working on loops and functions and finding when it's best to use these!
